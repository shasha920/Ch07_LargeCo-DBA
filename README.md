# Ch07_LargeCo-DBA

The _Ch07_LargeCo_ database stores data for a company that sells paint products. The company tracks the sale of products to customers. The database keeps data on customers (LGCUSTOMER), sales (LGINVOICE), products (LGPRODUCT), which products are on which invoices (LGLINE), employees (LGEMPLOYEE), the salary history of each employee (LGSALARY_HISTORY), departments (LGDEPARTMENT), product brands (LGBRAND), vendors (LGVENDOR), and which vendors supply each product (LGSUPPLIES). Some of the tables contain only a few rows of data, while other tables are quite large; for example, there are only eight departments, but more than 3,300 invoices containing over 11,000 invoice lines. For Problems 28â€“55, a figure of the correct output for each problem is provided. If the output of the query is very large, only the first several rows of the output are shown.
